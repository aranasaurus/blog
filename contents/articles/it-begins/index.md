After attending [the Realtime Conference](http://2013.realtimeconf.com/) this weekend,
I came home bursting with inspiration to get my online identity reclaimed. There were
several talks about this topic, but [Amber Case's](http://caseorganic.com) [The Open
Web and the Opportunity of Now](http://caseorganic.com/notes/2013/10/22/2/realtimeconf-indieweb-ownyourdata)
sums it up quite nicely. You should watch it!

This is the start of my venture into the Indie Web.

## What next?

I expect to post pretty much everything here, be it pics of the kids, articles about nerdery, or my attempts at quantified self. Then I will syndicate these
things out to their other appropriate channels (Twitter, Facebook, Flikr, etc) in true [POSSE](http://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE) fasion.

Looking forward to getting this all set up. For now it's just the default theme from [Wintersmith](https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith) and this intro. I have lots of work to do! :)
